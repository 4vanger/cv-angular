	<p>Hi. My name is Andrew Kulinich and you are reading (actually using) my resume. I am UI development expert, team lead and R&D office manager.</p>
	<p>As for me - best resume for developer is code he creates. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/4vanger/cv-angular">CV source code</a> at github. This project is my playground to try <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a> framework</p>
	<p>When I got interested how whisky is made - I built my own distillery at home. Yes, I'm hacker - I'm interested how things are made. When something is not working correctly - I will get to the root of problem, fix it and learn from that. I hate poorly written code, incorrect indents or inconsistently named variables. Code should be perfect - only then it will work correctly.</p>
	<p>I love Javascript a lot because it is so easy and agile. And today I could write anything with Javascript - not only browser UI, but also server-side and mobile apps. I love it so much that even this resume is written on Javascript - check out page source.</p>
	<p>I live in Ukraine, but I'm ok to relocate if necessary.</p>
	<p>Don't forget to check <a href="#/jobs">list of companies, I was working for before</a> and <a href="#/projects">projects, I am proud of</a>. Feel free to <a href="#/contacts">contact me</a> if you need my help.</p>
